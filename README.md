# React Portfolio SPA
  
  ## Description
  This is my portfolio page, updated to use React instead of just html/css. In its current state, it's not quite complete. I plan to update the visuals to be a bit more organized and attractive, as well as make it more responsive. I'll have more projects to add soon as well.
